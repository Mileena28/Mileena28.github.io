                    <h2 class="section-title">When Trauma Becomes a Weapon</h2>
                    <div class="character-description">
                        <p>Dominic embodies the raw, unfiltered rage of systematic oppression transformed into violent resistance—a man whose personal trauma has been weaponized into a blunt instrument against Zenithian persecution. As Meridia's lieutenant and enforcer, he represents the faction within the resistance that prioritizes immediate, brutal action over long-term strategic patience, driven not by ideology or grand vision but by the simple, burning need to make those who destroyed his life pay the same price.</p>
                        
                        <p>His grizzled exterior and suspicious nature reflect someone who has learned that survival depends on constant vigilance and that trust is a luxury the Forsaken cannot afford. Weathered by years of hardship and marked by the brutal realities of underground existence, he carries the collective wound of all who have been branded, exiled, and "forgotten" by Zenithian doctrine. When he speaks of families being "torn apart" and lives being "ripped away," he gives voice to trauma that extends far beyond his personal experience.</p>

                        <p>Yet beneath his explosive temperament and willingness to employ brutal methods lies a man driven by fundamentally protective instincts. His violence, however excessive, springs from genuine desire to shield other Forsaken from experiencing the devastation he has endured. This creates the dangerous paradox of his character—someone who uses cruelty to defend gentleness, brutality to protect innocence, becoming the very monster his enemies painted him as in order to prevent others from suffering the same fate.</p>

                        <p>Dominic's character illustrates the dangerous transformation that occurs when legitimate grievance is allowed to fester without healing, when survival requires abandoning moral complexity in favor of brutal simplicity. His evolution from whatever he was before Forsaking to the hardened enforcer he has become demonstrates how systematic oppression creates its own monsters—people so damaged by persecution that they mirror what they fight against.</p>

                        Dominic's brutality serves a fundamentally protective purpose—he has become a weapon so that others don't have to, absorbed the moral corruption of violence so that the vulnerable can remain innocent. Yet this sacrifice risks consuming him entirely, transforming protector into predator. His story demonstrates how oppression creates cycles of violence, how the fight against monsters often requires becoming monstrous, and how the line between justice and revenge can disappear in the face of systematic cruelty.

                <h2 class="summary-title">The Price of Righteous Fury</h2>
                <div class="summary-content">
                    <p>Dominic represents the dangerous alchemy of legitimate grievance transformed into destructive rage, embodying the reality that systematic oppression creates its own monsters—people so damaged by persecution that they become mirrors of what they fight against. As Meridia's enforcer and the voice of collective Forsaken trauma, he demonstrates how the line between protector and predator can disappear when survival requires moral compromise and emotional numbness.</p>

                    <p>His brutal methods serve genuinely protective purposes—he has absorbed the moral corruption of violence so that others don't have to, become a weapon so the vulnerable can remain innocent. Yet this sacrifice risks consuming his humanity entirely, transforming his defensive instincts into indiscriminate aggression. His story illustrates the uncomfortable truth that those who fight monsters often must adopt monstrous methods, and that the cure can become worse than the disease.</p>

                    <p>Through his interactions with captured enemies and suspicious newcomers, Dominic reveals the depth of collective Forsaken wounds—not just anger at persecution, but grief for families destroyed, belonging severed, and fundamental human dignity stripped away by religious extremism. His explosive confrontations serve as both emotional release and strategic tool, using shared trauma as weapon against ideological conditioning while processing his own unhealed pain.</p>

                    <p>His relationship with Mira exposes the tension between legitimate security concerns and displaced trauma. His suspicion of her stems partly from genuine protective instinct and partly from his inability to trust anyone who hasn't shared the Forsaken experience of systematic betrayal. His opposition to her presence reflects both tactical wisdom and emotional defensiveness, illustrating how trauma can make even rational caution indistinguishable from paranoid aggression.</p>

                    <p>The success of operations like the Zenithian Hall bombing demonstrates that his brutal efficiency serves strategic purposes, that his willingness to employ violence achieves resistance goals that patience and diplomacy cannot. Yet his methods also risk drawing unwanted attention, escalating conflicts beyond manageable levels, and corrupting the moral foundation of the resistance movement itself.</p>

                    <p>Ultimately, Dominic embodies the profound moral complexity of revolutionary violence and the question of whether noble ends can justify brutal means. His character asks whether there is a point where the resistance becomes indistinguishable from what it opposes, where the fight for human dignity requires abandoning humanity itself. Through his struggle between protective loyalty and destructive rage, he represents both the necessity and the danger of violent opposition to systematic oppression, proving that sometimes the greatest threat to a revolution's soul comes not from external enemies but from the moral compromises required for survival and victory.</p>
