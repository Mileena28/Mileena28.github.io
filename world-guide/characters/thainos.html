                    <div class="character-description">
                        <p>In the time before time, when the First Gods shaped reality through will and song, there lived Thainos—youngest of the divine siblings, creator of humanity, the one who dared to believe that consciousness was gift rather than burden. When his celestial family mocked his clay-born children as flawed and doomed, he made a choice that would echo through eternity: he would descend to walk among them, forsaking omnipotence for the chance to prove their worth.</p>
                        
                        <p>For over a thousand years, he wandered the mortal realm as Aren—healer, teacher, friend to the friendless. Born into genuine humanity yet carrying the suppressed memories of godhood, he searched tirelessly for one perfect soul, one being untouched by corruption who could justify his faith in the species he had breathed to life. His was a divine heart learning to beat in mortal chest, infinite love constrained by finite flesh, yet made more precious by its very limitations.</p>

                        <p>The hollow ache that lived beneath his ribs was homesickness for paradise, the weight of cosmic sorrow compressed into human form. Yet through centuries of rejection, betrayal, and loss, his compassion never wavered. He loved without condition, served without reward, and continued believing in humanity's potential even as evidence mounted against him. His story is the ultimate testament to faith persisting not because it is guaranteed, but because it is chosen.</p>

                <h2 class="summary-title">Love That Chose to Break</h2>
                <div class="summary-content">
                    <p>Thainos represents the ultimate expression of divine love choosing mortal vulnerability to understand and serve what it has created. His journey from confident creator-god to sorrowful wanderer to transcendent sacrifice demonstrates that true divinity is not found in power over others, but in willingness to suffer with and for them. His story reveals that gods become most godlike when they choose to be human, and humans become most human when they choose to love without guarantee.</p>

                    <p>The thousand-year search for perfect innocence was simultaneously a success and failure—he never found the uncorrupted soul he sought externally, yet through his searching became the very perfection he hoped to discover. His inability to find validation for his faith in humanity ultimately led to the greatest validation possible: the transformation of his own divine essence into scattered seeds of compassion within human hearts. Every act of selfless love, every moment of hope chosen despite evidence, every gesture of kindness without expectation carries the echo of his sacrifice.</p>

                    <p>The hollow ache that tormented his mortal existence was revealed to be homesickness for his true nature—not as distant deity, but as love incarnate walking among those he had created. His apparent failure to prove humanity's worth became humanity's greatest gift: the divine spark distributed among finite beings, enabling every person to carry potential for transcendent compassion. Through his willing descent from omnipotence to vulnerability, he proved that creation's highest expression is not in remaining separate and perfect, but in choosing connection despite the certainty of heartbreak.</p>

                    <p>His legacy lives not in monuments or worship, but in every human heart that chooses love over fear, hope over despair, service over self-preservation. The sacred is not found in avoiding the broken world, but in entering it fully, loving it completely, and trusting that even scattered light can illuminate the darkness—not by overpowering it, but by inspiring others to kindle their own flames of compassion in response. Thainos proved that the divine finds its highest expression through apparent defeat, that true creation happens through sacrifice rather than command.</p>

                    <p>In losing himself completely, he saved not just humanity, but the very concept of divine love—proving it real not through power, but through the willingness to suffer for what cannot be guaranteed, yet must be believed. His transformation from seeking perfection to becoming it, from finding the divine to distributing it, represents the ultimate victory of love over despair, hope over evidence, and faith over the cynical certainty that goodness is impossible. The God Who Wept became the light that never dies, scattered but never diminished, present in every choice to love without condition, to serve without reward, to hope without guarantee.</p>
