                    <div class="character-description">
                        <p>Across the vast expanse of Quenos and Atheria, mortals whisper prayers to the moon when storms rage too fiercely, when tides rise too high, when the very fabric of night seems torn by grief too profound for mortal understanding. They do not know they address Elodias, God of the Moon and Lord of Tides, whose sorrow reshapes reality itself.</p>
                        
                        <p>Once, Elodias embodied the quiet wisdom of moonlight and the patient rhythm of ocean tides. His divine essence complemented Senia's radiant warmth with cool contemplation, her active creativity with reflective depth. Together, they maintained the cosmic balance between day and night, sun and moon, fire and water. Their love was meant to be eternal harmony—instead, it became eternal tragedy.</p>

                        <p>Now he exists caught between godhood and heartbreak, wielding cosmic power that he cannot use to solve the one problem that matters. His immortal devotion transcends death, time, and consequence, but this very transcendence has become their prison. He loves Senia so completely that he cannot conceive of a universe where she might be better off without him.</p>

                        <p>Elodias embodies the paradox of infinite power coupled with profound emotional vulnerability. His divine nature grants him mastery over cosmic forces, yet his love for Senia renders him as helpless as any mortal facing loss. This contradiction defines every aspect of his existence—he who commands the tides cannot stem the flow of his own grief.</p>

                <h2 class="summary-title">Love That Transcends and Destroys</h2>
                <div class="summary-content">
                    <p>Elodias embodies the shadow side of perfect love—the terrifying truth that even the purest emotion can become destructive when it refuses to accept limitation. As God of the Moon and Lord of Tides, he was designed to be Senia's eternal complement, the contemplative darkness to her radiant light. Their cosmic romance should have been a story of harmony and balance. Instead, it became the ultimate tragedy of love that demands possession over celebrating existence.</p>

                    <p>His immortal devotion transcends death, time, and cosmic consequence, but this very transcendence has become their prison. He loves Senia so completely that he cannot conceive of a universe where she might be better off without him. This failure of imagination—beautiful and terrible in its absoluteness—condemns them both to eternal repetition of their tragedy. The curse that binds them is ultimately unnecessary; Elodias's own nature has already made him incapable of the choice that would free them.</p>

                    <p>What makes his story particularly heartbreaking is his awareness of his own destructiveness. He understands the cosmic mathematics perfectly: his presence triggers her divine awakening, which leads inevitably to her death, which causes him grief that reshapes reality and harms countless innocents. He knows he is the problem, knows he could end their suffering by choosing to forget her, knows that his love has become a weapon pointed at everything he claims to cherish.</p>

                    <p>Yet this knowledge changes nothing. If anything, it deepens his tragedy by adding the weight of conscious choice to unconscious compulsion. He is not a victim of fate but an active participant in their destruction, choosing his need for her over her freedom, his grief over her peace, his love over her life, again and again across eternity. His perfect memory ensures that each cycle carries the accumulated weight of all previous losses, making him not just a god in love but a being literally dying of love.</p>

                    <p>Through Elodias, we see how love itself can become a form of violence when it prioritizes the lover's needs over the beloved's wellbeing, when it chooses intensity over sustainability, when it mistakes obsession for devotion. His story reveals romantic idealism's beautiful lies—that true love conquers all, that it justifies any sacrifice, that it transforms suffering into nobility. In choosing love over wisdom, passion over compassion, reunion over release, he becomes both architect and prisoner of his own eternal tragedy.</p>

                    <p>The moon will always chase the sun across the heavens, drawn by a love that predates creation and will outlast existence itself. But chasing is not catching, pursuit is not possession, and love that cannot let go eventually strangles what it seeks to protect. Elodias stands as proof that even gods can mistake obsession for devotion, that even divine love can become profoundly selfish, and that sometimes the greatest act of love is the one we refuse to perform—the choice to set the beloved free.</p>
