                    <h3>The Story Through Music</h3>
                    <p>
                        This isn't just a soundtrack—it's the story of The Chosen told through music. Each track follows 
                        Mira Roehart's harrowing journey from a free-spirited young woman in a coastal town to a survivor 
                        fleeing supernatural forces and psychological destruction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When charismatic religious leader Lucien Altheris arrives in Rivenglade promising salvation through 
                        absolute faith, the town eagerly surrenders to his Light. But Mira sees through the divine facade to 
                        the predator beneath. What follows is a descent into coercive control, forced marriage, and systematic 
                        destruction—until an ancient power awakens within her, offering one final chance: run or die.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Musical Landscape:</strong> Blending Celtic fiddle, tribal drums, Nordic orchestral elements, 
                    and haunting vocal lamentations, the soundtrack creates an immersive sonic world where the ancient and 
                    modern collide.</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 1: The Light That Swallowed the Silence</h3>
                    <p>
                        Five years after the Silence devastated the realm, refugees flood into the coastal town of Rivenglade. 
                        Then Lucien Altheris arrives—a fallen star in white robes with impossibly blue eyes. He preaches absolute 
                        truth: Zenith is the one true god, and all others are demonic lies. The Wild Gods—the ancient spirits woven 
                        into Rivenglade's forests and seas—are suddenly condemned as evil. While all of Rivenglade kneels before 
                        this new Light, Mira stands at the edge of the pier, caught between the blazing certainty of Zenith's 
                        followers and the wild, untamed truth pulsing in her blood.

Ah-ah-ah-oh... Mmm-ah-yah-oh... Way-oh-way-oh...

The tide pulls hard, it knows my name
Its ancient song, untouched by flame
Five years since silence stole our voice
Now refugees drift without choice
Oh-way-ah... oh-way-ah...

The pier groans beneath their feet
Solarian ash and Atherian wheat
All washed ashore on Rivenglade stone
While I stand watching, still alone
Mmm-ah-yah-oh...

A fallen star in robes of white
Claims one truth to end our night
His voice like honey, smooth as wine
Says other gods are false design
Hey-yah... hey-yah...

The marketplace forgets its song
Now prayers replace what lived here long
My violet eyes see through his glow
To shadows only wild things know
Oh-ah-way-oh...

Of moonlit woods and sacred springs

Still lives in me... still lives in me...

My dearest friend now speaks his name
"Zenith's chosen" she became
Her hazel eyes reflect his fire
While mine still hold the forest's choir
Ah-yah-oh... ah-yah-oh...

She says there's peace in being chosen
But I feel something wild and frozen
The pines still whisper ancient lore
Of what existed long before
Way-oh-way...

Under moon, the forest wakes
Its shadows pulse, its spirit shakes
A trembling note, the air it breaks
A truth no single god can take

The tide, the wind, the earth's own beat
Their voices rise where wild things meet
Hey-yah, hey-yah, oh-way-oh
The old ones know, the old ones know...

The town turns swift, their eyes alight
A blazing faith to drown the night
But I stand here where waves take flight
And feel the dark hold back the light
Mmm-oh-ah... mmm-oh-ah...

Their spirits dance in mist and stone
They call me home, I'm not alone
Though all of Rivenglade may kneel
The wild remembers what is real
Oh-way-oh-way...

Forever wild, forever free...

                        At a mandatory Zenithian sermon, Mira struggles under the faith's suffocating expectations. Desperate 
                        for answers about her absent mother, Mira confronts her father Elias. His cryptic response devastates her: 
                        "She's not like us, Mira. She walks a different path—a path we can never follow." Her violet eyes mark 
                        her as eternally separate. Seeking solace at a hidden waterfall with her best friend Kat, their philosophical 
                        debate reveals Kat's complete transformation. Under mounting pressure, Mira reluctantly agrees to speak with 
                        Lucien—a compliance that feels like a lie that may destroy her authentic self.

Mother, mother... You walk a path I cannot follow... Cannot follow...

White walls closing in on me
Incense choking what I breathe
Dress too tight, can't find my skin
They say kneel, but I can't give in
Mmm-oh-ah... mmm-oh-ah...

Father's books won't speak her name
"She's not like us," his voice in pain
Violet eyes stare back at me
Mirror shows what I might be
Oh-way-oh... way-oh...

Mother, mother, where'd you go?
Walk a path I'll never know
Mother, mother, am I you?
Is that why I can't make it through?

She's not like us... not like me...
Different path... set my soul free...

But I RUN! I RUN! Through the ancient trees!
Bare feet flying, finally free!
The waterfall calls my name!
I leap into the wild gods' domain!

Cold water holds me, I'm ALIVE!
The forest knows I will survive!
No white robes can bind my soul!
The wild makes me whole! Makes me whole!

Kat says "be chosen, wash it clean"
But I still hear what she's not seen
Nymphs in pools and dryads near
Old gods whisper what I fear
Hey-yah-oh... hey-yah-oh...

"She walks a different path," he said
Those words keep spinning in my head
Am I the bridge she couldn't be?
Between the wild and what they need?
Oh-way-oh-way...

At the falls! At the falls!
Where the old magic calls!
Strip away what isn't real!
Let the wild gods make me feel!

Hey-yah! Hey-yah! Oh-way-oh!
Diving deep where shadows go!
Hey-yah! Hey-yah! Oh-way-oh!
This is all I need to know!

So I RUN! I RUN! Through the ancient trees!
Bare feet flying, finally free!
The waterfall drowns their prayers!
I breathe the wild gods' sacred air!

Cold water holds me, I'm ALIVE!
Mother's blood helps me survive!
No baptism can claim my soul!
The wild makes me whole! I AM whole!

Mother, mother... Your different path...
Maybe leads... Back to me...

Maybe I'm the path... You couldn't follow...

                        Mira reluctantly meets with Lucien to discuss her doubts, but finds herself trapped in masterful psychological 
                        manipulation. Unable to sleep, she is drawn into the forest at midnight where she discovers a mysterious stone 
                        and receives a supernatural warning: a Nimwe appears, matching Mira's violet eyes, warning that "too much light 
                        will make you blind." Despite this divine intervention, Mira's crushing loneliness drives her toward a decision 
                        she knows is wrong—she chooses to undergo the Baptism ritual, trading her wild truth for the illusion of belonging.

"Too much light will make you blind..."
"...make you blind..."

I held a silver feather once
A creature made of void and stars
She sang to me of balance lost
Of light that leaves eternal scars
Ah-oh-ah... oh-ah...

Now father kneels in pristine white
My dearest friend has lost her way
And I stand here between two worlds
Knowing which one I'll betray
Way-oh-way... oh-way...

They say "join us, be chosen, belong"
But the woods still sing their warning song
I feel myself disappearing
Into light that's searing
I'm disappearing…

Too much light will make you blind
When you cannot see, you'll follow
I'm walking into my cage tonight
Trading truth for something hollow

The Nimwe warned me, warned me well
But loneliness is my private hell
So I surrender what is mine
To the light that makes me blind

Tomorrow they will wash me clean
Of everything I used to be
The forest gods will call my name
But I'll pretend I cannot see
Oh-way-ah... ah-oh...

Lucien smiles like he's already won
His hand a shackle on my soul
I nod and smile and play along
While a future untold pays the toll
Hey-oh-hey... oh-hey...

I'm sinking, sinking, sinking down
(The Nimwe said beware)
Into white robes, into their crown
(But I'm too scared to care)

I'm fading, fading, fading out
(The wild gods know I lied)
This light is killing all my doubt
(And everything inside)

Too much light will make you blind
When you cannot see, you'll follow
I'm walking into my cage tonight
My spirit breaking, hollow

The Nimwe warned me, I know it's true
But I'm too afraid to be without you
So I'll wear white and speak their lines
Let the light make me blind
Make me blind...

Silver feather locked and hidden
Wild prayers now forbidden
I am walking to my drowning
In the light, in the light
In the blinding light...

"Too much light..."
"...will make you..."
"...blind..."

I know... I know...
But still I go... Still I go...

                    <p>
                        Mira's resistance shatters when her father converts after meeting with Lucien. At the sermon, Lucien announces 
                        missionary expansion and isolation doctrine—non-believers are now "dangerous contamination." Trapped between 
                        total isolation and spiritual surrender, Mira capitulates. Walking through Rivenglade's unnatural transformation, 
                        she meets Lucien. His possessive touch and claim he "always knew" she'd convert reveals something inhuman beneath 
                        his divine facade. This duet captures their ideological battle—the subtext of opposing worldviews as Mira walks 
                        toward baptism, knowing she's betraying herself.

I see the darkness clinging to your soul
Like shadow wrapped around your violet eyes
You think I haven't noticed what you are?
The void is calling and you still reply

Let me save you from the Wild Gods' lies
Let me wash away the stain they left behind
Surrender to the Light and you'll be pure
Let me heal what you've become

You speak of darkness like it's something wrong
But shadows held me when the world went cold
The Wild Gods whispered when I felt alone
You want to take the only home I've known

I won't abandon forests for your throne
I won't trade whispers for your absolute
You say the void has stained my very bones
But maybe, my darkness is the truth

Don't you want to finally belong?
Don't you want to know where you fit in?
I can give you certainty, not doubt
All you have to do is let me in

But what's the cost of your belonging?
What do I lose to wear your white?
You promise peace but I hear warning
In every word you call "the Light"

Let me save you from the shadow
I don't need your blinding flame
I can feel the void inside you
Maybe darkness knows my name

You're afraid of being whole
I'm afraid of losing me
Zenith's Light will set you free
Too much light and I won't see

Can't you see what's at stake here?
Can't you feel what's pulling us apart?

I'm trying to save your soul
You're trying to steal my heart

The Wild Gods left you broken and alone
They let the Silence swallow everything
But I can offer order, peace, control
A purpose higher than their withered wings

You think you're different? You were always meant
To rise above the chaos they embraced
The void is not your friend, it's your descent
Unless you let my Light illuminate your face

The Nimwe found me crying in the woods
She didn't promise certainty or lies
She said too much of your blinding light
Would leave me stumbling, following the blind

You want me certain, but I'd rather doubt
You want me whole, but I'd rather be free
The ancient stones still hum with older truth
Your Light's not meant for something wild like me

I feel it when I touch you
That otherness, that stain
The void is living in you
And I can't let it remain

You'll destroy yourself without me
You'll be lost inside the dark
Let me be your shepherd
Before the shadows rip you apart

You don't want to save me
You want to own my soul
You don't want to heal me
You want absolute control

The darkness that you sense here
Isn't evil, isn't wrong
It's the part of me that's wild
The part that won't belong

I'll save you from the shadow
I don't want your blinding flame
I can purge the void inside you
The void is part of my name

You're choosing chaos over peace
I'm choosing truth over your cage
You'll regret this, mark my words
Better wild than your slave

This is where our paths diverge
This is where the battle starts

I will save your soul
You'll never have my heart

The Nimwe left me something
A silver feather in the night
A reminder that the darkness
Isn't always wrong
And your light...
Isn't always right.

You'll come to me eventually
They always do
The Light is patient
And so am I

You can't run from what you are...
Forever.

                    <p>
                        The baptism ceremony reveals Zenithian conversion's true nature. As Lucien channels blinding white light into 
                        Mira, she experiences violent intrusion—not salvation but annihilation designed to erase personality and rewrite 
                        consciousness. However, something ancient in her blood creates an impenetrable barrier that completely repels 
                        Zenith's power. For the first time ever, Lucien's ritual fails. He maintains the facade of success to preserve 
                        his authority, but both now know the truth: Mira is immune to the supernatural mind control that has successfully 
                        converted everyone else.

Barefoot on the marble cold
A thousand eyes, a thousand souls
Watching, waiting, wanting more
As I walk toward the altar door
Mmm-ah-oh... ah-oh...

White gown hanging like a shroud
Incense choking, lilies bowed
Every step echoes my fear
The golden light is drawing near
Oh-way-ah... way-ah...

Kat is praying for my soul
While I'm about to lose control
The marble drains my body's heat
As I lay down in my defeat
Hey-oh-hey... oh-hey...

His hand upon my head like fire
The vow I speak is born of liars
"I give my body, mind, and soul"
But something stirs beyond control...

He's reaching in, he's reaching deep
Into the places where I sleep
Burning light tries to erase
Everything about my face

But something ancient starts to rise
Something he can't recognize
From blood and bone, from shadow's keep
A power that was always asleep
Always asleep...

Lifted up into the air
The congregation stops to stare
They think it's grace, they think it's gold
But I can feel him lose his hold
Ah-yah-oh... yah-oh...

His fingers twitch against my skin
He cannot make his light get in
Behind his smile I see the crack
The shadow watching, watching back
Way-oh-way... oh-way...

Not my will, not my choice
Something deeper finds its voice
Ancient blood beneath my skin
Won't let Zenith's light come in

He pushes harder, I push back
Not with light but something black
Not evil, no—just something free
Something wild protecting me
Protecting me!

He's pulling back, he's letting go
There's something here he doesn't know
The Light recoils from what I am
His perfect ritual is a sham

And in his eyes I see the truth
Behind the light, behind the proof
A shadow wearing holy clothes
And now he knows... he knows I know
He knows I know...

"Rejoice!" he cries to hide his fear
"Another Chosen standing here!"
They cheer and clap and sing their praise
While darkness swims behind his gaze

I stand before them, playing my part
With something ancient in my heart
Untouched by light, unmarked, unknown
A wild thing wearing Chosen clothes
Wearing Chosen clothes...

                        contempt escalates to mob violence while Lucien watches impassively before warning Mira: "Such is the fate of

I stood before the altar in my robe of holy white
My husband on his knees below, condemned by Heaven's light
They said to speak his name aloud would stain my children's souls
So I turned my face to stone and let the silence take its toll

This is how the light devours
This is how we break apart
Stone by stone and hour by hour
Tearing out each beating heart

We were family, we were whole
Now we're shadows in the sun
They save the body, damn the soul—
Look what we've become
What we've become...

He crawled to me in daylight with our children at my side
Begged to say goodbye to them—I felt my mercy die
I closed my eyes against him as the righteous gathered near
I did what faith required of me, though it cost me dear

I did what faith required of me
I set my husband's spirit free
But in the dark when no one sees
I hear him calling through the trees...

Mmm-ah-oh... ah-oh...

This is how the light devours
This is how we break apart
Stone by stone and hour by hour
Tearing out each beating heart

We were family, we were whole
Now we're shadows in the sun
They save the body, damn the soul—
Look what we've become
What we've become...

We were brothers, we were sisters
Till the Light declared us wrong
Now we're phantoms, now we're nothing
Singing exile's bitter song

Oh-way-oh... way-oh...

They stripped him bare before us all
The priest's hand burning bright
We watched the mark sear through his flesh—
The brand of banished light

I saw them spit upon his skin
I saw them throw the stones
The children screaming for their da
While mother turned to bone

The marketplace ran red that day
The faithful sang and jeered
And Lucien stood above it all
With neither smile nor tear

This is how the light devours
This is how we break apart
Stone by stone and hour by hour
Tearing out each beating heart

We were family, we were whole
Now we're shadows in the sun
They save the body, damn the soul—
Look what we've become
What we've become...

They said the Nimwe whispered lies into his willing ears
That darkness called him to the woods and fed him on his fears
But in the silence of the night when Zenith's eye won't see
I wonder if the Nimwe's voice was kinder than our creed

I did what faith required of me
I set my husband's spirit free
But in the dark when no one sees
I hear him calling through the trees...

Mmm-ah-oh... ah-oh...

What we've become... What we've become...
Calling through the trees...
Mmm-ah-oh...

                        Summoned to Lucien's quarters, Mira discovers he found the Nimwe feather. When she attempts denial, Lucien threatens 
                        to plant the feather in Kat's home, resulting in her immediate Forsaking and certain death. His ultimatum: marry him 
                        to prove devotion to Zenith's Light, or watch Kat die for a crime she didn't commit. At the pier, even nature is

Can't breathe... can't scream...
Still water in my lungs... Oh-ah-oh... drowning...
While standing in the sun...

I want to tear my throat wide open
Spill the truth like crimson wine
Tell them what crawls beneath his smile
How his kiss tastes like brine

But still water fills my mouth
Every time I try to speak
The monster's fingers in my chest
Playing with what makes me weak
Oh-way-oh... can't bleed it out...

My skin is screaming underneath the white
My bones are breaking with each step I take
But all they see is still water
Perfect bride without a wake

Still water in my throat, I'm choking
On the vows I cannot say
That he's eating me alive
While they throw flowers in my way

My forest wedding dies inside me
Moss and earth turned into stone
I'm swallowing still water
While the monster takes me home
Takes me whole... swallows whole...

They laced me up in white surrender
Pulled the corset till I split
But the real chains are invisible
The ones that make me submit

I had a lover made of lightning
Who would dance between the trees
Now I'm marrying still water
That will freeze me by degrees
Mmm-ah-oh... freeze my screams...

If I could vomit up the truth
If I could bleed it on their floor
Show them how his touch devours
How he feeds on what I was before!

But still water keeps me quiet
Still water keeps me tame
I'm dissolving in his presence
Forgetting my own name...
My own name... what's my name?

Tomorrow he'll unhinge his jaw
And swallow what remains of me
But tonight they celebrate
The still water ceremony

My father kissed my forehead
Where the monster's mark will go
He thinks he's giving me away
He'll never, never know
Oh-ah-oh... never know...

Still water in my throat, I'm drowning
In the daylight, dressed in lace
The congregation's singing hymns
While something takes my face

My forest lover's just a carcass
That I carry in my chest
Still water is dissolving
Everything I once possessed
Once confessed... now suppressed...

I cannot slit my throat to tell you
(Still water, still water)
What waits beneath the gold
(Be still now, be still)

The monster wears a holy face
(Still water, still water)
And I'm already cold
(So cold... so cold...)

Can't... breathe...
Still water... In my lungs...

                        time becomes meaningless. Lucien forces her return to public life where she must perform as the devoted wife while

                        shame and confusion.

Step inside, they close the door behind me
White and gold but nothing here defines me
Hands on skin I never said could touch
"You're blessed," they say, but blessings shouldn't hurt this much

Father gone to spread the holy word
Best friend sent where monsters haven't heard
Left me here with hymns and empty walls
Husband, shepherd, predator—he's all

They see the ring, they see the vow, they see me smile
But I've been underwater for a while
Holding breath, holding still, holding on
To a girl who's been erased since I put this white dress on

Wash it off, wash it off, but the stain won't fade
(Won't fade, won't fade)
Pray it off, pray it off, but I still feel the weight
(The weight, the weight)
I'm a ghost in the house where they worship his name
(His name, his name)
Holy ghost, holy ghost, and I'm drowning in shame
(In shame, in shame)

Numb, numb, going numb when he enters the room
Float up, float away, leave my body consumed
Scrub raw in the morning till the water runs red
Can't wash off the feeling that I'm already dead

They smile in the marketplace, "You're glowing, my dear"
I'm smoke, I'm a shadow, I'm not really here
Mirror shows a stranger in a borrowed face
Wearing his name like it's taking my place

And the cruelest part? (What's the cruelest part?)
When the vessel betrayed, when it played its part
Body said yes when my mind screamed no
Now the shame's another chain I can't let go

Wash it off, wash it off, but the stain won't fade
(Won't fade, won't fade)
Pray it off, pray it off, but I still feel the weight
(The weight, the weight)
I'm a ghost in the house where they worship his name
(His name, his name)
Holy ghost, holy ghost, and I'm drowning in shame
(In shame, in shame)

They call him light (But I see the dark)
They call him blessed (But I bear the marks)
They call it sacred (But it feels like theft)
They call me wife (But there's nothing left)

Serpent in the shepherd's clothes
Monster that nobody knows
Everybody bows and prays
To the man who takes and takes and takes

But there's a forest that remembers me!
There's a blade that could set me free!
There's a girl beneath this holy ghost!
And she's the one I'm saving most!

Walk it off, walk it off, to the woods I'll fade
(I'll fade, I'll fade)
Take it off, take it off, all the white, the shame, the cage
(The cage, the cage)
I'm a ghost leaving the house where they worship his name
(His name, his name)
Holy ghost, holy ghost, but the wild calls my name
(My name, MY NAME)

I'm a ghost, I'm a ghost (But not for long, not for long)
I'm a ghost, I'm a ghost (Gonna be gone, gonna be gone)

He can keep his heaven... I'm going home

                    <p>
                        At the hidden waterfall where she plans to end her life, Mira raises Lucien's stolen dagger to her chest. Her 
                        desperate plea—"Please… give me a reason to live"—triggers supernatural intervention. A Nimwe emerges from the 
                        mist, touching her forehead and triggering a violent magical awakening. Power erupts from within as violet light 
                        explodes from her body. Something vast and long-buried rises to the surface. The dagger falls forgotten as she 
                        realizes: she doesn't have to die to escape. She can run.

To the falls, to the falls, to the falls I go
(Let me go, let me go)
To the deep, to the dark, to the undertow
(Let me go, let me go)

Through the vines, through the green, through the shadowed way
Past the moss, past the stones where we used to play
Dagger cold against my chest, silver in my hand
One last breath, one last step to the promised land

Violet eyes watching from the trees
Soul burning through the mist
Something ancient, something wild
Something I can't resist

I see through the holy lie
I see the predator's eyes
I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done
Tonight I run!

Run, run, run from the monster in the light
Run, run, run, I'm getting out tonight
Run, run, run to the forest, to the wild
Run, run, run like a feral child

He can keep his heaven, keep his throne
I'm running to the woods, I'm going home
Run, run, run from the monster in the light
Run, run, run, I'm getting out tonight!

He calls it love, I call it chains
He calls it blessed, I call it pain
Wolf dressed up in shepherd's clothes
But the forest called and now I know

The Nimwe showed me violet flame
Whispered "starling" - my real name
I don't have to die to be free
I just have to run, just have to flee

I see through the holy lie
I see the hunter in disguise
I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done
Watch me run!

Run, run, run from the monster in the light
Run, run, run, I'm getting out tonight
Run, run, run to the forest, to the wild
Run, run, run like a feral child

He can keep his heaven, keep his throne
I'm running to the woods, I'm going home
Run, run, run from the monster in the light
Run, run, run, I'm getting out tonight!

Hey-nim-we, hey-nim-we, oh-way-oh...
Hey-nim-we, hey-nim-we, ah-yah-ah...

Monster, monster in the holy light (Run away, run away)
Monster, monster thinks he owns my life (Run away, run away)
But I'm faster than his chains tonight (Run away, run away)
I'm wild, I'm awake, I'm taking flight (Run away, RUN AWAY)

He'll wake up and I'll be GONE!
Into the forest, into the dawn!
He can't follow where I'm going!
The wild is mine and I AM RUNNING!

Run, run, run from the monster in the light
Run, run, run, I'm getting out tonight
Run, run, run to the forest, to the wild
Run, run, run like a feral child

He can keep his heaven, keep his throne
I'm running to the woods, I'm going home
Run, run, run from the monster in the light
Run, run, run, I GOT OUT TONIGHT!

Run, run, run, run away (I got away, I got away)
Run, run, run, run away (I got away, I got away)
From the monster, from the light (I got away, I got away)
Into the forest, into the night

I GOT AWAY!

                    <p>
                        Mira returns to gather survival supplies, but Lucien arrives unexpectedly, sensing something fundamentally different 
                        about her magical awakening. During a Zenithian service, Forsaken rebels bomb the Hall. In the chaos, Mira attempts 
                        escape but Lucien confronts her, triggering violent manifestation of her void magic—black tendrils that burn his flesh. 
                        His shocked revelation—"She's Nimwe"—suggests she may be a supernatural being who believed herself human. Fleeing into 
                        the forest, she encounters a terrifying Beastborn and a mysterious woman rescuer. Mira chooses to trust this stranger, 
                        vanishing into the unknown.

Heaven's bleeding golden light
The altar cracks, the temple sighs
Something holy splits the night
And I'm the ember, I'm the fight

The saints are falling from their thrones
A thousand colored pieces rain
I'm gathering the fragments of my soul
Racing through this blessed hurricane

My whole life sewn in leather seams
Every secret, every prayer
I turn to find him in the smoke
Standing between me and the air

Do I stay with the devil I know?
The monster wearing holy robes?
Or do I run into the night?
Into the dark, away from his light?

Into the unknown wild I go
Where the shadows breathe and rivers flow
I don't know what's waiting there
But anything's better than his prayers

Into the unknown, into the trees
Where the darkness might just set me free
The devil I know wants me to stay
But I choose the wild, I choose to run away
Into the unknown wild
Into the unknown wild

His fingers close around my wrist
I panic and the shadows twist
Black tendrils tear from my skin
Something ancient waking deep within

He screams my secret to the sky
"She's Nimwe!" - but I won't die
Not here, not now, not in his cage
I'm running on adrenaline and rage

The forest looms ahead of me
Darkness promising I could be free
But I don't know what monsters hide
In the shadows on the other side

Into the unknown wild I go
Where the shadows breathe and rivers flow
I don't know what's waiting there
But anything's better than his prayers

Into the unknown, into the trees
Where the darkness might just set me free
The devil I know wants me to stay
But I choose the wild, I choose to run away
Into the unknown wild
Into the unknown wild

Hollow eyes in the forest deep
Beastborn prowling while I weep
A stranger's voice cuts through the night
"I can save you if you trust me right"

The evil that I know would break me
The monster in the light would take me
Drag me back to white and gold
Back to being bought and sold

But the unknown - the unknown calls my name
The wild is dangerous but I'm not the same
I'd rather die free in the woods I love
Than live as his possession in the house of his god

Into the unknown wild I run
Trading his chains for the rising sun
I don't know what tomorrow brings
But tonight I'm free, tonight I have wings

Into the unknown, into the night
Where the forest swallows all his light
The devil I knew almost made me stay
But I chose the wild, I ran away
Into the unknown wild
Into the unknown wild
Into the unknown wild

I don't know what's out there
But I know what's behind me
And I'll take my chances with the dark

Fire behind me
Forest ahead
The old life dying
A new one instead
Into the wild...
Into the wild...
Into the wild...

I'm free
