  content: "I built this website as my own little space carved out of the internet—something personal, a place to share my passions and everything that makes me who I am. It started as a safe haven, but over time, it's grown into something much more. From the world guide for my fantasy universe to the community page where I've begun sharing other people's stories of trauma and giving them a voice, this site has become a reflection of both my heart and the stories that matter to me. But real life has been heavy lately. The demands of my day-to-day work have drained so much of my energy, leaving me too exhausted to fully dive into the things I love. I know I've fallen behind on updating stories, and I'm sorry for that. I haven't forgotten them. I'll return to them—because writing is what I truly want to be doing. I dream of the day when that's all I have to do. Just write and write and write, without anything standing in the way."

Somehow, it still works. Lately, I've been working on a song about stalkers, because—for some strange reason—that topic keeps showing up in my life. Apparently, I'm… interesting."

  content: "Maybe it makes me naïve, but I've never been good at hiding how I feel. I've always been willing to set aside my pride and say the things most people wouldn't dare say out loud. That honesty gets me in trouble sometimes, but I don't know how to be any other way. If being vulnerable helps even one person feel less alone, then maybe the discomfort is worth it."
