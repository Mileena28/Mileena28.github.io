<p><em>I can't believe this. I just made the most important discovery of my entire research career and NOW they want to kick me out? The timing couldn't be worse!</em></p>

<p>I woke up this morning still buzzing from yesterday's sprite encounter, ready to dive deeper into my research, and there was that horrible letter slipped under my door. Reading it felt like having cold water dumped over my head. Fifteen silver pieces a day in fines? "Gentle but firm physical escort"?</p>

<p>I had to try something. I couldn't just give up when I was so close to answers.</p>

<p><strong>The Municipal Hall Disaster:</strong><br>
<em>Location: Elden Ridge Municipal Authority building</em><br>
<em>Time: Mid-morning</em><br>
<em>Outcome: Complete humiliation</em></p>

<p>I marched straight down to the Municipal Hall with that stupid letter clutched in my fist, absolutely determined to make them understand the gravity of the situation. Surely if I explained what I'd discovered, if I showed them that there was a REAL problem that needed investigating, they'd see reason!</p>

<p>I was so wrong.</p>

<p>The moment I walked through those doors, I started talking - probably too fast, definitely too loudly. I waved that letter around like it would somehow help them understand, gesturing frantically as I tried to explain about the water sprite's behavior, the bitter water, the concerning signs of something bigger happening.</p>

<p>"You don't understand!" I heard myself saying, my voice getting higher and more desperate. "This isn't just academic curiosity! The sprite warned me about something called 'The Silence' - it's coming! Something is fundamentally wrong with the nature spirits in this area!"</p>

<p>The more I talked, the more uncomfortable they looked. When I mentioned The Silence, I saw them exchange worried glances. Not the good kind of worried - the 'this person might be dangerous' kind of worried.</p>

<p>"Miss, you need to calm down," one of them said, but I couldn't calm down! How could I calm down when they were trying to stop me from investigating what could be a serious supernatural threat?</p>

<p>"The Silence is COMING!" I shouted as they literally started pushing me toward the door. "You need to listen to me!"</p>

<p>SLAM.</p>

<p>The door shut right in my face.</p>

<p>I stood there for a moment, breathing hard, staring at the wooden door that had just been closed on what might be the most important research of my life. Then I turned around and said the first thing that came to mind:</p>

<p>"You'll regret this!"</p>

<p><em>Note to self: Probably not the most diplomatic parting words for future municipal relations.</em></p>

<p>I slumped down against the door, pulled my knees up to my chest, and buried my face in my arms. All that work, all those discoveries, and now I was banned from continuing. I felt utterly defeated.</p>

<p><strong>An Unexpected Rescue:</strong><br>
<em>Location: Still slumped pathetically outside Municipal Hall</em></p>

<p>That's when I heard a familiar voice: "Is everything all right?"</p>

<p>I looked up to find the warden standing there, looking genuinely concerned. For a moment, I was so surprised I forgot to answer. Then a horrible thought occurred to me.</p>

<p>"Are you... stalking me?" I blurted out. "You seem to show up everywhere I go!"</p>

<p>He actually laughed at that. "I work here. And I live here. It's not exactly stalking when you're just... existing in the place where you exist."</p>

<p>My cheeks burned with embarrassment. "Oh. Right. That makes perfect sense. Sorry."</p>

<p>"What happened?" he asked, nodding toward the municipal building.</p>

<p>I held up the crumpled letter without lifting my head from my arms. "I got a cease and desist order. They want me to stop my research immediately or face fines I can't afford."</p>

<p>He took the letter and read it carefully, making thoughtful humming sounds. "I'm sorry to see this," he said finally. "Are you part of a research organization? That would give you authorization to continue."</p>

<p>"No," I said miserably. "I was doing this on my own. I had no idea there were so many rules about... well, everything apparently."</p>

<p>"Would you like to be?" he asked.</p>

<p>I looked up, puzzled and intrigued. "Perhaps...? What's the catch?"</p>

<p>"I'm not really sure there is one," he said thoughtfully. "But I saw an invitation recently to a place called the Hollow Spire. They'd recently put together some kind of scholarly organization. Let me see if I can find it."</p>

<p>He walked over to a bulletin board near the Municipal Hall entrance and returned with a formal-looking notice.</p>

<p>"Oh my gods, thank you!" I practically shouted, jumping to my feet. "This is exactly what I need! How do you always have exactly what I need?"</p>

<p>He smiled that lovely smile again and looked a bit shy. "Speaking of having what you need... would you maybe be available for a date tonight?"</p>

<p>My mind was racing with possibilities about this Hollow Spire application. "I have to focus on writing this letter! This is so important!"</p>

<p>"I could help you craft the perfect letter," he suggested. "I mean, if you'd like."</p>

<p>I stopped mid-pace and really looked at him. That was actually... incredibly thoughtful. And practical. And sweet.</p>

<p>"That's..." I started, then realized how genuinely helpful that would be. "That's actually a wonderful idea. Thank you."</p>

<p>"Maybe we could meet by the river one last time? We could work on the letter and then..." He trailed off hopefully.</p>

<p>"All right," I agreed. "Let's meet at dusk."</p>

<p>His whole face lit up with this pleased expression that made something flutter in my chest.</p>

<p>As I watched him walk away, clearly excited that he'd scored another date with... well, with me apparently, I realized several things at once:</p>

<ol>
<li>I was incredibly excited to write this application letter</li>
<li>Maybe I could get him to write a letter of recommendation - with how much he seems to like me, he probably would</li>
<li>With absolute horror: I was going on a SECOND date with this man and I STILL didn't know his name</li>
<li>At this point, it would be completely ridiculous to ask</li>
</ol>

<p>I slowly peeked around the corner, watching him walk away with that pleased spring in his step, then turned back around. That's when I noticed a secretary standing nearby who had apparently been watching this entire exchange unfold.</p>

<p><em>Note to self: Really need to learn to be more aware of my surroundings. This is getting embarrassing.</em></p>

<p>I walked up to her, trying to look casual. "Excuse me, do you know that guy?"</p>

<p>"You mean Dani?" she said.</p>

<p>"Ah yes, Dani," I said, trying to sound like I definitely knew this already. "Is he pretty trustworthy?"</p>

<p>She looked puzzled. "Yes, he's quite highly respected among the municipal court for his work with the sacred fauna. Why?"</p>

<p>My stomach dropped. He was highly respected municipal authority and I'd been treating him like... like an afterthought. Like someone whose name I couldn't be bothered to remember.</p>

<p>A pang of guilt crashed over me. Here I'd been planning to use his obvious interest in me to get a letter of recommendation, and he'd been nothing but helpful and kind.</p>

<p>No. I wouldn't do that. I should actually give him real attention on this date because he really has helped me a lot. Dani deserves better than being used for my academic advancement.</p>

<p>Although... Dani? That seems like a nickname. I wonder what his full name is?</p>

<p><em>Research priorities for tonight:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Write the perfect application letter to the Hollow Spire</li>
<li>Actually pay attention to Dani as a person, not as a means to an end</li>
<li>Try to figure out his real name without making it obvious I've forgotten</li>
<li>Don't completely mess up this potential romantic situation while focusing on academic opportunities</li>
</ol>

<p><em>One day I'll learn to balance research and personal life. Today is apparently not that day.</em></p>
