<p><em>I made it! And I already have ACTUAL RESEARCH!</em></p>

<p>My feet are absolutely screaming at me and I've been bitten by every bug in existence, but I'm finally in Elden Ridge! Three days of walking and I'm pretty sure I have blisters on my blisters, but I DID IT. I'm here and I'm doing field research and oh gods I have no idea what I'm doing but I'm doing it anyway!</p>

<p>I spent the morning just standing in the town square trying to figure out how to even <em>start</em> talking to strangers about water problems. Do you just walk up to people and ask about their well? Is there some sort of protocol? My tutors never covered "How to Approach Random Villagers for Information Without Seeming Completely Mad."</p>

<p>Finally I just... did it. Walked right up to the first elf I saw and asked about the water situation.</p>

<p><strong>First Interview Attempt:</strong><br>
<em>Subject: Young elven male, approximately 25-30 years, brown hair, green eyes</em><br>
<em>Location: Town square, near the merchant stalls</em><br>
<em>Time: Mid-morning</em></p>

<p>"Excuse me, I'm researching the water situation here. Have you noticed any problems with the wells or streams?"</p>

<p>He looked a bit surprised but smiled—really lovely smile—and said, "Water problems? Not that I've heard of. Are you with the municipal planning committee or something?"</p>

<p>When I explained I was an independent researcher, he seemed even more intrigued. Turns out he's a warden of the Ridge—"I watch over the sacred animals, the ones that bear divine markings. Make sure no hunters come after them unlawfully. Fascinating work, really. Each marking tells a story about which god blessed them."</p>

<p>Then he asked, "Would you like to see the river? I could show you where the main tributary flows through town."</p>

<p>My feet were practically weeping at the thought of more walking, but this was perfect! A guided tour of the water source from someone who knows the area. I said yes immediately.</p>

<p><em>Research Note: Local wardens may be excellent sources for environmental information. They observe natural patterns regularly.</em></p>

<p><strong>Walk to the River - Additional Observations:</strong><br>
<em>Subject: Same as above (really must remember to get names at introductions)</em><br>
<em>Duration: Approximately 20 minutes</em><br>
<em>Route: From town square to primary water source</em></p>

<p>As we walked, he explained more about his work: "The sacred animals have been more... restless lately. Agitated. The blessed deer won't come down to drink at the usual spots, and the marked foxes keep moving their dens upstream. Started about a moon ago."</p>

<p>When I asked if he thought it was connected to water quality, he shrugged. "Could be. Animals sense things we don't. Though honestly, I haven't noticed anything wrong with the water myself."</p>

<p><em>Important: Animals avoiding water sources could indicate contamination or spiritual disturbance. Must investigate further.</em></p>

<p><strong>Critical Interview - Water Complaint Witness:</strong><br>
<em>Subject: Older elven male, approximately 60-70 years, grey hair, weathered hands (possibly agricultural work)</em><br>
<em>Location: Main town well</em><br>
<em>Time: Late morning</em></p>

<p>This is where things got interesting! I spotted him shouting at someone near the well and had to excuse myself from my walk (rather abruptly, I'm afraid) to investigate.</p>

<p>Initial interaction:<br>
<em>Him: "Who in the blazes are you and what do you think you're doing interrupting private conversations?"</em><br>
<em>Me: "I'm sorry, I'm a researcher. Is this about the water problems? I'm here to help."</em><br>
<em>Him: [looking utterly baffled] "How do you know about the water? Who sent you?"</em></p>

<p>When I explained I'd heard rumors about bitter water and failing crops, he EXPLODED with information:</p>

<p><em>"It's that damn water sprite! Thinks it's so funny, we've got ourselves a comedian in nature! The thing has ONE JOB—clean the water, make it flow proper—and what does it do instead? Runs around squirting people in the face, getting them soaked, then laughing and running away like some sort of... of... delinquent child!"</em></p>

<p><em>"Been going on for nearly two moons now. Water tastes like it's been sitting in a rusty bucket, crops are yellowing, and that sprite just keeps playing its stupid games. Yesterday it got my grandson right in the face when he was trying to draw water for his mother. Soaked him head to toe and then had the audacity to giggle about it!"</em></p>

<p><em>"We used to leave offerings—fresh bread, honey cakes, little tokens of appreciation. Sprite kept our water crystal clear for thirty years! Now it won't even do its basic duties because it's too busy being a prankster!"</em></p>

<p>When I introduced myself properly and explained my research mission:<br>
<em>Me: "I'm Alaquinn Althaea, and I'm studying nature spirits to understand their behaviors and needs."</em><br>
<em>Him: [shaking my hand limply, still confused] "The Quality team is sending out weirder and weirder people these days. Do they even care anymore about proper protocol?"</em></p>

<p><em>Research Note: He seems to think I'm part of some official water quality inspection team. Makes sense—probably assumes anyone asking about water problems must be with municipal authorities.</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Research Questions Arising:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Why would a water sprite suddenly abandon its duties after 30 years of faithful service?</li>
<li>What changed two moons ago that might have triggered this behavioral shift?</li>
<li>Is this connected to The Great Withdrawal or divine silence?</li>
<li>What are the sprite's actual motivations for the pranks?</li>
<li>Who or what is this "Quality team" the man referenced?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Physical Evidence to Investigate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bitter taste in well water (need to test personally)</li>
<li>Yellowing crops (visible signs of water contamination?)</li>
<li>Specific locations where sprite has been seen</li>
<li>Pattern of prank behavior</li>
</ul>

<p>This is absolutely fascinating! A nature spirit abandoning its traditional role to engage in seemingly pointless mischief. There has to be a reason—spirits don't just change their entire nature without cause. Tomorrow I need to actually locate this sprite and attempt communication.</p>

<p>But first: sleep, foot balm, and something for these infernal bug bites. My arms look like I've been in battle with tiny, very persistent enemies.</p>

<p><em>Note: Pack better boots next time. And insect repellent. LOTS of insect repellent.</em></p>
