<p><strong>OFFICIAL NOTICE OF RESEARCH CESSATION</strong><br>
<em>Statute 847-B: Unauthorized Investigation of Municipal Resources</em></p>
</div>

<hr>

<p><strong>To the Young Elven Woman Currently Conducting Unofficial Inquiries Regarding Water Quality Within Elden Ridge Municipal Boundaries:</strong></p>

<p>Greetings and salutations in the spirit of civic cooperation and mutual understanding.</p>

<p>It has come to the attention of the Elden Ridge Committee for Nature Utilities and Environmental Oversight that an individual matching your description has been observed conducting what appears to be unauthorized research activities within our jurisdiction. While we deeply appreciate scholarly interest in our community's natural resources, we must inform you that such investigations require proper municipal authorization and credentialing through established administrative channels.</p>

<p>Per our records, no research permits have been issued to independent investigators within the current administrative quarter. Furthermore, multiple community members have reported interactions of a concerning nature, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unauthorized testing of municipal water supplies without proper safety protocols</li>
<li>Public solicitation of anecdotal testimony regarding community infrastructure</li>
<li>Documented attempts to communicate with local fauna in a manner deemed disruptive to public order</li>
<li>General conduct that has resulted in citizen complaints regarding unusual disturbances</li>
</ul>

<p>In accordance with Municipal Statute 847-B, subsection 12, regarding "Unauthorized Investigation of Municipal Resources by Non-Credentialed Individuals," we must formally request that you immediately cease all research activities within Elden Ridge boundaries. This cessation order includes, but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Collection of water samples or quality assessments</li>
<li>Interviews with residents regarding municipal services</li>
<li>Documentation of local environmental conditions</li>
<li>Any activities that could be construed as official investigation without proper authority</li>
</ul>

<p>Please be advised that failure to comply with this cessation order within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt will result in the assessment of administrative fines as outlined in Municipal Code Section 203-C, beginning at fifteen silver pieces per day of continued violation. Should said fines prove uncollectable due to insufficient funds, Municipal Statute 914-A authorizes the gentle but firm physical escort of non-compliant individuals beyond community boundaries by authorized peacekeeping personnel.</p>

<p>We wish to emphasize that this directive stems not from any personal animosity, but from our solemn duty to maintain civic order and protect both our citizens and visiting scholars from potential misunderstandings or complications that might arise from unsanctioned research activities.</p>

<p>Should you wish to pursue legitimate research within our community at a future date, we encourage you to submit proper applications through the Office of Academic Liaison, located in the Municipal Hall during standard business hours (dawn to dusk, excluding holy days and harvest festivals).</p>

<p>We trust you will understand the necessity of these measures and comply promptly with this directive. We wish you safe travels and scholarly success in properly authorized endeavors elsewhere.</p>

<p>In service to the community and the pursuit of orderly academic progress,</p>
