Sometimes the most profound truths emerge not from finding answers, but from discovering that our questions were born from the wrong assumptions entirely.

I spent the first eighteen years of my life on my knees, begging a silent heaven for signs that I mattered. Small prayers, mostly—the desperate whispers of a child trying to survive in a world that felt designed to break them. Please make them stop hurting me. Please let someone see. Please just let me know you're there.

The silence was so complete it felt like mockery.

In the Kingdom Hall where I grew up, we were taught that Jehovah heard every prayer, that he cared about every sparrow that fell. But I wasn't a sparrow—I was a child drowning in plain sight, and the sky remained empty of rescue. Night after night, I would lie awake wondering what was wrong with me that even God couldn't be bothered to acknowledge my existence.

Was I too broken? Too sinful? Too small to matter to the infinite?

The questions ate at me like acid, dissolving whatever faith I'd been taught to build my life upon. If God was real and chose not to help, he was cruel. If he was real and couldn't help, he was powerless. If he wasn't real at all, then everything I'd been taught was a lie designed to keep me compliant while those in power did whatever they pleased with my childhood.

By the time I escaped that organization, I had settled on the third option. God was a fairy tale invented by adults to make children behave and trauma survivors grateful for their suffering. Prayer was performance, faith was delusion, and silence was exactly what you'd expect from a universe that contained no one listening.

I thought I had figured it all out. I thought my pain had taught me the ultimate truth: we are alone.

But even after losing my faith, even after deconstructing every belief I'd ever held sacred, some stubborn part of me kept reaching toward something beyond the visible world. Maybe it was wishful thinking. Maybe it was conditioning too deep to root out. Or maybe—and this thought both terrified and comforted me—maybe the questions I'd been asking were wrong from the beginning.

## The White Crows We Ignore

Years later, while researching life after death and the supernatural in our world, I encountered Jeffrey Mishlove's work on postmortem survival of consciousness. In his research, he references William James's famous observation: to prove that not all crows are black, you need only find one white crow. Just one. A single piece of evidence that contradicts the absolute claim.

Mishlove documents what he calls humanity's "white crows"—the extensive evidence for consciousness surviving physical death that mainstream science largely ignores. Near-death experiences with verifiable details. Mediums providing information they couldn't possibly know. Reincarnation cases with documented historical accuracy. Communication from the deceased that transforms entire families.

One white crow is all it takes to prove that our materialist assumptions might be incomplete.

But here's what struck me about his research: most people, when confronted with white crows, look away. Even when presented with compelling evidence that consciousness might persist beyond death, that there might be more to existence than the narrow band of reality we can measure, we often choose comfortable skepticism over uncomfortable possibility.

Why? Because if there's more—if consciousness survives, if there are realms beyond this one, if something vast and aware might actually exist—then we have to grapple with the original question that haunted our childhoods: Why doesn't it intervene? Why doesn't it answer? Why does it let us suffer?

The skeptic's universe is cruel but simple: we suffer because suffering is random, meaningless, inevitable. There's no one to blame, no one to rage at, no hope for intervention. It's devastating but clean.

A universe that contains consciousness beyond death, potentially vast intelligences aware of our pain, forces that could intervene but choose not to—that's far more difficult to accept. It brings back all the childhood questions about divine indifference and abandonment, but with the added weight of potential reality.

## When Fiction Becomes Philosophy

I was deep into writing "Blood of the Wild Gods: The Lost Histories" when the idea struck me like lightning. I had been crafting the character of Tanneus G'Raja, a scholar obsessed with unearthing the truths of the gods that went silent. His story was supposed to explore how knowledge and truth can be dangerous—how some discoveries destroy the seeker rather than enlighten them. But as I wrote his final testament, something shifted.

What if the gods' silence wasn't abandonment? What if it wasn't indifference? What if it was the greatest act of love they were capable of?

From Tanneus's final writings:

> *"The gods are not absent. They are not deaf. They are not indifferent to our suffering. They are right here—closer than our own breath, nearer than our heartbeat—holding themselves back with a restraint so absolute it looks like abandonment. Every moment of every day, they love us enough to remain silent. To stand at the very edge of intervention and choose, again and again and again, not to speak."*

As I wrote those words, I felt something fundamental shift in my understanding. Not my belief—I'm still not sure what I believe about divine existence. But my framework for approaching the question changed entirely.

> *"Because they learned—through apocalypse, through the unmaking of stars, through watching reality itself crack beneath the weight of their good intentions—that divine words reshape existence. That every blessing becomes a curse in time. That every gift, no matter how lovingly given, becomes a weapon in mortal hands. That love expressed directly from the infinite to the finite doesn't elevate; it incinerates."*

Suddenly, the silence that had tortured me as a child took on a different quality. What if unanswered prayers weren't evidence of divine cruelty, but divine restraint? What if the very thing I had begged for—direct divine intervention—was exactly what would have destroyed me?

## The Catastrophe of Answered Prayers

Consider what happens when prayers are answered in the stories we tell. When gods intervene directly, when divine will reshapes mortal reality, when infinite power touches finite lives. In mythology, folklore, even modern fiction, the pattern repeats: divine gifts become curses, blessed individuals become isolated from ordinary humanity, direct contact with the infinite tends to annihilate rather than elevate.

Think of King Midas, whose granted wish became his torment. Of the mortals who glimpsed gods in their true forms and were destroyed by the sight. Of every fairy tale where getting exactly what you asked for turns out to be the worst possible outcome.

What if these stories aren't just cautionary tales about being careful what you wish for? What if they're cultural memories of a time when the divine was more present, more responsive—and when that responsiveness nearly destroyed everything?

In my fantasy world, I imagined the Wild Gods as beings who loved mortals so completely they couldn't bear to see them suffer. They didn't prevent every tragedy, but they tried. They intervened where they could, answered prayers when possible, reached out with fierce protective love. And in doing so, they broke the fundamental structures that allow mortality to exist at all. Their love became a cosmic catastrophe that required other gods to choose between letting love destroy creation or stopping love to preserve it.

> *"The Wild Gods were everything I believed divinity should be. Compassionate. Present. Active in mortal affairs. They walked among us, loved us, protected us with fierce devotion. They gave us everything I spent my life insisting we deserved. And they destroyed the world with their kindness."*

Writing this fictional cosmology recontextualized every unanswered prayer of my childhood. What if the silence hadn't been cruelty? What if it had been the most profound mercy possible—the mercy of restraint from beings whose very attention could unmake the delicate structures that allow mortal consciousness to exist?

## The Ecology of Silence

There's an ecology to existence that might require divine distance the way a forest requires the absence of constant sunlight. Too much divine attention might be like too much radiation—initially energizing, ultimately destructive. The gaps, the spaces, the apparent abandonment might be as necessary as the darkness between stars.

I think about the research on consciousness survival, about all those white crows we keep documenting and dismissing. What if awareness does persist beyond death? What if there are vast intelligences aware of our struggles? What if they maintain their distance not out of indifference, but out of a love so profound it accepts being misunderstood rather than risk our destruction?

This isn't the same as the religious platitudes I was fed as a child—"have absolute faith," "pray more," "trust in Jehovah's timing," "your faith is being tested." Those explanations put the burden on us to accept our pain as evidence of our own spiritual inadequacy, to believe that if we just prayed harder or had stronger faith, somehow the silence would break. 

This is different. This suggests that the silence itself is an act of sacrifice by whatever vast awareness might exist beyond our perception. That being ignored by the divine might actually be evidence of how much we're loved—too much to risk the cosmic catastrophe that divine intervention could unleash.

## Writing Blood of the Wild Gods: The Lost Histories

Writing "Blood of the Wild Gods: The Lost Histories" became an unexpected meditation on these same themes. What started as six interconnected mythologies (stories about eternal lovers cursed to find and lose each other across lifetimes, jealous seers weaving fate into weapons, gods searching millennia for human innocence that doesn't exist, divine beings cast out for choosing mercy over law, wealth rewriting murder into heroism, and the cosmic war that taught gods the terrible price of answering prayers) turned into something much more personal.

Each tale forced me to confront questions I'd been avoiding: What happens when love becomes obsession? When goodness proves impossible? When the right choice doesn't exist? When wealth can literally purchase history? When caring too much destroys what you're trying to protect? I thought I was writing about ancient gods and forgotten tragedies. Instead, I found myself excavating the deepest philosophical wounds of human existence.

The character of Tanneus G'Raja, the scholar who unearths these lost histories, became my unwitting mirror. The deeper he dug into divine sorrows, the more he unraveled. The more truth he uncovered, the more it destroyed his certainties. I didn't realize it at the time, but I was writing about myself—about what happens when you refuse to look away from the darkest questions of existence, when you insist on digging until you find bedrock truth, even when that truth might crack your foundation.

Like Tanneus, I found that some knowledge transforms the knower beyond recognition. That seeking answers to questions like "Why don't the gods speak?" might lead you to discoveries that make you wish you'd never asked. That the most dangerous thing a truth-seeker can do is actually find what they're looking for.

The Lost Histories became my own meditation on the terrible beauty of questions that matter more than their answers. To the recognition that some silences might be more sacred than any words. To the possibility that love might sometimes express itself through distance, restraint, and the mercy of remaining hidden.

In the end, both Tanneus and I learned the same devastating lesson: the deepest truths often transform us into cautionary tales about the dangers of seeking them. But perhaps that transformation is its own kind of answer—not to the questions we asked, but to the questions we should have been asking all along.

If you're curious to explore these dark mythologies yourself, you can read more about [Blood of the Wild Gods: The Lost Histories](/writing/the-lost-histories/) and dive into the individual tales that forced me to confront the most uncomfortable questions about love, power, innocence, and the price of divine caring.

## Living with Sacred Questions

Maybe the point isn't to solve the mystery of divine silence. Maybe the point is to live with the question in a way that doesn't break us. To find frameworks that allow us to hold both the pain of apparent abandonment and the possibility that love sometimes wears the mask of distance.

As Tanneus writes in his final testament:

> *"The gods' silence is their greatest gift. Pray they never love us enough to speak again."*

I don't know if I believe this literally. But I know that considering it has changed how I hold the silence that once tortured me. The prayers that went unanswered, the cries for help that seemed to echo in empty space, the desperate reaching toward something that never reached back—maybe all of it was actually evidence of a love too vast to risk expression.

The white crows are there for those willing to see them. The evidence for something beyond this narrow band of reality continues to accumulate. But perhaps the greatest evidence for divine love isn't intervention—it's the silence that preserves the delicate ecology of mortal existence.

And sometimes, just sometimes, being ignored by heaven is the greatest blessing we never knew we received.

*If you're interested in exploring the research on consciousness survival that inspired these thoughts, I highly recommend Jeffrey Mishlove's "Beyond the Brain: The Survival of Human Consciousness After Permanent Bodily Death." His documentation of the "white crow" phenomenon offers compelling evidence that our understanding of consciousness and mortality might be far more limited than we assume.*

*And if these ideas resonate with your own spiritual journey—whether you're recovering from religious trauma, exploring new frameworks for meaning, or simply trying to make sense of the silence in your own life—know that you're not alone in the questioning. Sometimes the most profound faith emerges not from having answers, but from learning to live beautifully with mysteries that matter.*
