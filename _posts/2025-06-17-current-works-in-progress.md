I'm currently working on two very different projects. The first is *The Chosen*, the sequel to my debut novel *The Silence* in my *Blood of the Wild Gods* series. It takes place five years after the events of the first book. The realm is fractured. People are desperate for something to believe in—some steady ground after so many waves have crashed through their lives. Then a man appears from the eastern islands, bringing promises of light and order. In a time of chaos, people cling to it. And slowly, my main character's quiet coastal town begins to change.

This book dives into the psychology of cults—how easy it is to fall into them, how isolating it can be once you're inside, and how damaging blind certainty can become. I based the group known as Zenith's Chosen on the high-control religious environment I was raised in from birth until I finally left at eighteen. In many ways, this story mirrors my own. I didn't realize it at first, but writing this book became a way of working through the trauma I carried from that time.

I've always wanted to do something meaningful for others who've left controlling religious groups—or who are still trapped in them and thinking about leaving. I didn't know how to help practically, but this book became my answer. It's my offering. My way of saying: I see you. You're not alone. I hope it does that justice.

My second project started as a side escape—something lighthearted to give me a break from the emotional intensity of *The Chosen*—but it quickly grew into a passion project of its own. It's called *The Lost Histories*, and it's narrated by Tanneus G'Raja, a scholar from the Hollow Spire who guides the reader through the forgotten myths and legends of this world. You're discovering these stories right alongside him, and his voice adds a layer of introspection I've never seen done quite like this before. He prepares you for what's coming, then gently helps you process what you've just read—not by telling you what to think, but by giving you space to think more deeply.

Originally, I just wanted to flesh out the backstories of the gods so I could reference them in the main series. But the project became so much more than that. It built a richer, more interconnected world. Some characters even cross over between stories. Some truths in this book reshape how you see events in *The Chosen*. I love those "Oh wait…!" moments as a reader, and I've tried to create that same experience here.

What I'm most proud of, though, is how these stories explore the deeper layers of what it means to be human. They touch on themes like how history is rewritten by those in power, how belief systems can evolve or be manipulated, and how obsession—like stalking—can shatter lives in tragic and disturbing ways. They're heavy topics, but I believe they're worth facing.

At the heart of everything I write is a desire to connect—not to provide escape, but to create space for reflection. I don't flinch away from hard truths. I know that means my work won't be for everyone. I know it'll make some people uncomfortable or even upset. But that's the point. These subjects are uncomfortable to live through, so I believe they should be uncomfortable to read about too. Not to glorify them, but to expose them for what they are.

My goal is never to romanticize trauma. It's to be honest about it. To help people who've never lived it understand how devastating it is—and to offer recognition and maybe even healing to those who have.

I know this kind of writing isn't likely to make me famous. But that's not why I write. I write to tell the truth, even when it hurts. Especially when it hurts.
