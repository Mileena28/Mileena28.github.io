Here it is. My website. A place I've finally decided to create so I can share my creative work and unfiltered thoughts—and maybe spare my friends and family a little bit on social media.

This all came about after a really difficult chapter in my life. I recently experienced homelessness. And when I made it through that and finally found stable housing, I shared a post on social media to process everything I'd gone through. I needed to say it out loud. To reflect, to release it. A lot of people responded with compassion and said it resonated with them—but some took it the wrong way. That part really hurt.

Something I was traumatized by was turned around and thrown back at me, like it was just a choice I made. I don't think it was said with malice, but it still stung. It made me realize something: **I need my own space.** A place where I can speak freely and reach the people who actually want to hear what I have to say—not just react to it. A space for people who are drawn to my music, my writing, my way of seeing the world.

## Finding My Voice

Over time, I've come a long way in how I express myself. I've learned how to communicate what's on my mind, even the hard stuff. I've realized I have a lot to say—and it's worth saying. I've lived through things that gave me perspective and insight, and I think that matters.

I've always been someone who's willing to say the things most people don't dare to. It's both a blessing and a curse. But I believe in the power of honesty—the raw, unfiltered kind. The kind that exposes not just the hard and ugly parts of life, but the beautiful, unrestrained parts too.

## My Little Refuge

So this is my space. My little refuge. And maybe, if you've been needing something like this, it can be yours too.

> "Sometimes we need to create our own corners of the world where our truth can breathe freely."

Here, I'll share the music that pours out of me at 3 AM. The stories that demand to be told. The thoughts that feel too big for small talk but too important to keep silent. The messy, beautiful, complicated reality of being human in a world that often prefers its truth sanitized and its emotions at a comfortable distance.

If you're here, thank you for choosing to listen. Thank you for being someone who isn't afraid of depth, who doesn't need me to dim my light to make you comfortable in your darkness.

Welcome to my little refuge. Make yourself at home.
