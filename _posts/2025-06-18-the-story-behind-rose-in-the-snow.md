*"Rose in the Snow"* is a song about being watched, doubted, and silently resented—yet choosing to bloom anyway.

This one came from a place I don't often speak about. It's about the strange ache of knowing people who never supported you are still watching you. Not to cheer you on, but to quietly hope you'll fall. It's about the kind of presence that hides behind silence—people who never say a word but click through everything you post. Who linger. Who lurk. Who know your highs and lows better than some of your family. And it's about the ones who tried to bury you with doubt, with judgment, with absence—and are still shocked when you rise.

## More Than Just Survival

But *Rose in the Snow* isn't just a song about being stalked or underestimated. It's a song about defiance. About surviving what was meant to break you. About growing in places that were never meant to nurture you. It's about refusing to shrink, even when the people around you are more comfortable with your silence.

> *"They tried to bury all that I could be, But the frost couldn't tame the flame in me."*

That line became the heartbeat of this song. It's the answer to every person who thought I would stay buried under their projections. Every person who pretended not to care, while obsessively tracking everything I did. Every person who said nothing while wishing for failure behind a screen.

> *"You won't say a word, but you want the tea— Sippin' my pain like it's VIP."*

## A Message of Defiance

This is for anyone who's ever felt quietly hated, quietly doubted, quietly watched. This is for the survivors, the creators, the ones who grew without permission. This is for the ones who chose to bloom through the frost, with no apology.

I am that rose. Still blooming. Still here.

And I'm not going anywhere.

*Have you ever felt like you were being quietly watched or underestimated? This song is for you. Sometimes the most powerful thing we can do is simply refuse to stop growing.*
