                        <p>I'm Mileena Rayne—nurse, mother, writer, and musician. I grew up in Minnesota, but I come from the kind of places you don't see on maps: fractured homes, quiet grief, and belief systems that tried to shape me into someone I wasn't. I don't create from theory or distance. I create from experience—real, raw, and lived. Everything I write, everything I sing, comes from a place that once hurt.</p>
                        
                        <p>I didn't start creating until almost thirty. Not because I didn't have anything to say, but because I was surviving. Once I started, I couldn't stop. Every lyric, every chapter, every note I play carries memory: trauma, truth, grief, clarity. I don't try to make it comfortable. I try to make it honest.</p>
                        
                        <div class="highlight-quote">
                            "I don't write to escape. I write to confront. Music is where I say the things I'm not ready to speak."
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>People call me "intense" a lot. And honestly, they're not wrong. I feel things deeply. I think about everything. I don't know how to pretend something's okay when it's not. That used to feel like a flaw. Now I see it as the reason I connect with people in ways that matter. It's what lets me write things that stay with people. It's what helps me show up for my patients. It's what drives me to speak up, even when it's hard.</p>
                        
                        <p>I grew up being told what to believe. Now I search for the truth, no matter how painful it is. Even when it hurts. Especially then.</p>

                <!-- My Story -->
                <section class="section">
                    <h2 class="section-title">My Story</h2>
                    <div class="section-content">
                        <p>I was born into a fractured family. When I was two years old, my parents gave me up, and my paternal grandparents stepped in to raise me. For most of my childhood, they were my foundation. Around the age of twelve, I moved in with my dad, his new wife, and her children. They later had a child together. Living with my dad gave me something I had longed for—but it wasn't without pain. My stepmother, caught in the unresolved tensions of her relationship with my father, often took her frustrations out on me. It was an emotionally abusive environment, one that left marks I still carry. Some wounds from childhood never quite fade, even when forgiveness or reconciliation enters the picture.<p> 
                            
                        <p>By fifteen, I had returned to my grandmother's care, unable to endure the emotional turmoil any longer. That was the beginning of instability in my life that would stretch well into adulthood. By sixteen, I was on my own—navigating the world without a roadmap, collecting more pain than answers. The trauma accumulated during those years held me back in more ways than I could see at the time. I never did live with my mother again, but she did come around when I was older and began to rebuild a relationship with me. It still feels distant most of the time, but I can see she's made an effort to bring me back into her life. She's a kind woman—just a little caught in her own world. I suppose I inherited that trait from her.</p>
                        
                        <p>Layered over all of this was the belief system I was born into. I was raised as one of Jehovah's Witnesses, a high-control religious group that shaped nearly every aspect of my identity. I left at eighteen, and that decision shattered everything I thought I knew. My entire worldview unraveled. I had to start from nothing—searching, questioning, aching for what was real. That unraveling became the root of my obsession with truth, even when it's uncomfortable. Especially when it's uncomfortable. Because after a life of being told what to believe, I needed to know what was real, no matter how painful it was to find it.</p>
                        
                        <p>That need to process—to unravel, understand, and rebuild—eventually led me to creativity. I didn't begin writing or making music until nearly thirty. But once I did, it became clear that everything I create comes from the life I've lived. Every song, every story, is stitched with memory, survival, and scars that never quite healed. Today, I'm a Registered Nurse and a mother to two incredible girls. I believe in honesty, even when it costs me. I'm passionate about trauma-informed care and dream of becoming a SANE nurse, a policy advocate, and an expert witness for survivors of abuse. I've learned the importance of speaking up, especially after being taught for so long to stay silent.</p>
                        
                        <p>Some people will probably still find fault in my words, no matter how carefully I try to say them. But I'm just trying to be honest about my experiences—because I've always been this way. Maybe it makes me naïve, but I've never been good at hiding how I feel. I've always been willing to set aside my pride and say the things most people wouldn't dare say out loud. That honesty gets me in trouble sometimes, but I don't know how to be any other way. If being vulnerable helps even one person feel less alone, then maybe the discomfort is worth it.</p>

                        <p>I believe that growth lives on the other side of discomfort. Most people spend their lives avoiding the very experiences that could transform them. I choose differently.</p>
