<hr />

<p>Sometimes a story arrives in your inbox that makes you stop everything. That makes you close your laptop and sit in silence because the weight of someone’s truth deserves that kind of reverence.</p>

<p>When I put out my call for stories, when I promised that every voice would be heard, that every experience mattered, I thought I knew what might come back. I was wrong. This person, this fellow traveler who left everything behind for truth, handed me their story like a broken bird. Carefully. Trusting me not to drop it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“You want an ex-Jehovah’s Witness story?”</em> they asked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Always yes. Because these stories matter. Because in the spaces between our stories, healing finds room to breathe.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="when-paradise-hides-hell">When Paradise Hides Hell</h2>

<p>They were born into it, like I was. We sat in the same Kingdom Halls, sang the same songs, believed in the same paradise. But behind the identical walls of our congregations, two children were living in completely different worlds.</p>

<p>What happened to them—what their father did, what their mother allowed, what the elders ignored—it breaks something in me to know it was happening while we were all singing about God’s love. While we were all pretending to be the happiest people on earth.</p>

<p>Their childhood held secrets mine didn’t. Darkness that no child should know. And yet we wore the same meeting clothes, carried the same book bags, knocked on the same doors with the same practiced smiles.</p>

<p>Their sister disappeared one day. No explanation. No goodbye. Just gone, sent to live with grandparents while the family continued their charade of righteousness. The brothers wondered, but children in the “truth” learn early not to ask questions that might have uncomfortable answers.</p>

<p>It would be ten years before they learned why she vanished. Ten years of their father sitting in the Kingdom Hall. Ten years of their mother’s silence. Ten years of pretending everything was fine while a child’s life had been shattered beyond repair.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“My father raped a child. Yet I am the monstrous black sheep of the family, because I left.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There it is. The truth that turns everything upside down. In the careful mathematics of high-control religion, leaving the faith is the unforgivable sin. Everything else can be overlooked, hidden, forgiven. But apostasy? That’s the only crime that matters.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-shepherd-who-hunted">The Shepherd Who Hunted</h2>

<p>At fifteen, they made the mistake of being caught with a Stephen King novel. In the congregation’s eyes, this made them “bad association”: spiritually dangerous, in need of stronger guidance. The elders had a solution: spend time with Larry, a ministerial servant. A spiritual mentor. Someone to set them on the right path.</p>

<p>I wonder sometimes about the delicate trust of children. How we hand it over to those who wear the right clothes, say the right words, carry the right title. Larry wore all of those things.</p>

<p>They woke one night to find his hands where they shouldn’t be. A child, frozen in the dark, trying to make sense of why God’s servant was doing this. They hid in the bathroom until morning light made it safe to call for rescue. But they never said why they stopped visiting Larry. Who would believe the “bad association” kid over a respected ministerial servant?</p>

<p>A year later, at a congregation gathering (one of those wholesome get-togethers with water gun fights and potluck dishes), Larry found them alone in a bathroom. Tried again. This time, they fought. Hit him with a water gun and ran.</p>

<p>Such a small weapon against such a large betrayal. But they fought.</p>

<p>When they finally found the courage to tell their parents years later, nothing changed. The story was received and filed away. They remained the problem. The apostate. The one who abandoned Jehovah.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-sister-who-carried-too-much">The Sister Who Carried Too Much</h2>

<p>When they escaped at twenty-one, their first act of freedom was to find their sister. After a decade of silence, they needed to know she had survived.</p>

<p>She had, but barely.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“She was killing herself with drugs and alcohol just to cope. No matter what I tried I could not stop her downward spiral, she killed herself about 13 years ago.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thirteen years, and the wound still bleeds through their words. How could it not? Their sister was sacrificed to protect an image. Sent away like a shameful secret instead of a child who needed justice, needed healing, needed someone to believe her.</p>

<p>When the pain finally became unbearable, she chose the only door she could find. And their parents, those guardians of righteousness, couldn’t even honor her in death. Attending an apostate’s funeral might displease Jehovah. Even if that apostate was your daughter. Even if her life ended because no one protected her when it mattered.</p>

<p>The same absence marked their grandparents’ funerals. Death after death, and the empty chairs where family should have been standing. All for an organization that protected the abuser and exiled the abused.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-price-of-asking-why">The Price of Asking Why</h2>

<p>After losing everything—family, friends, community, God himself—what remains? For them, it became a desperate negotiation with the universe:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“I figured the universe, or ‘god’ owed me some answers. I had literally, nothing else to lose.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>They dove deep into the searching. Read the Bible twelve times, looking for truth between the lines they’d been taught. Studied the origins of those ancient stories. Traced the fingerprints of older gods on newer scriptures. They weren’t just leaving a religion. They were archaeologists excavating their own buried truth from under decades of carefully constructed lies.</p>

<p>They tried to build something normal from the rubble. Got a good job with AT&amp;T. Moved to Omaha. Wore business clothes instead of meeting clothes. Focused on the material world they’d been taught to despise.</p>

<p>For a while, it almost worked.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="when-the-universe-answers">When the Universe Answers</h2>

<p>Near Thanksgiving 2007, something happened that would push them even further into isolation. They describe beings coming through their apartment wall like ghosts. An experience so far outside acceptable reality that sharing it became another kind of exile.</p>

<p>I won’t pretend to understand what happened that night. What matters is that someone who had already lost everything to their search for truth was given an experience that made that truth even harder to share. Another layer of separation. Another reason to stay quiet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Once the universe gives you glasses, and you put them on, you can never take them off, and you cannot force anyone else to look through them.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After begging the universe for truth, they received something that made them even more alone. There’s a terrible poetry in that: to survive religious trauma only to be handed a reality that isolates you further. To escape one unbelievable truth only to encounter another.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-geography-of-loneliness">The Geography of Loneliness</h2>

<p>They live alone now. Carry all of this packed away as carefully as they can manage. Their parents are aging, and they wrestle with whether to attend the funerals of people who wouldn’t attend their sister’s. Who wouldn’t attend theirs.</p>

<p>But here’s what takes my breath away: After everything—the abuse that should have destroyed them, the betrayals that should have made them bitter, the losses that should have ended them, the experiences that pushed them beyond what most can accept—they answered my call for stories.</p>

<p>They saw my invitation and thought: <em>Yes. I’ll trust one more time. I’ll speak one more truth. I’ll reach across this vast loneliness and see if anyone reaches back.</em></p>

<p>That’s not just survival. That’s the most profound kind of courage I know.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="why-every-word-matters">Why Every Word Matters</h2>

<p>In high-control religions, the architecture of silence is carefully built. Children learn which truths are speakable and which must be swallowed. Victims discover that their pain matters less than the congregation’s reputation. Those who finally speak face exile as their reward for honesty.</p>

<p>This person’s journey, from childhood in “the truth” to searching for truth among the stars, maps the territory so many of us travel after religious trauma. When the foundation cracks, when everything you believed becomes suspect, sometimes you have to be willing to look everywhere for what’s real. Even if that search takes you places others can’t follow.</p>

<hr />

<p>To the person who shared this story: Thank you.</p>

<p>Your truth matters. Every word of it. Even the parts others might not believe.</p>

<p>Your sister mattered. Your pain matters. Your search for truth matters.</p>

<p>And you matter. Not as an apostate. Not as a cautionary tale. But as a human being who deserved protection, love, and truth from the very beginning.</p>

<p>Thank you for answering my call. Thank you for trusting me with your broken bird of a story. I’m holding it carefully, I promise.</p>

<hr />

<div class="author-note">
<p><strong>From Mileena:</strong> This story came to me after I put out a call asking people to share their experiences, promising that their voices would be heard and their stories would matter. I'm grateful this person trusted me with something so profound and painful.</p>

<p>If you're an ex-JW or religious trauma survivor with a story to share, I'm here to listen. Sometimes the greatest healing comes from simply being heard. <a href="/contact/">Reach out anytime</a>.</p>

<p>And to those still trapped: The world outside is frightening, yes. You'll lose people you love. But there's truth out here. Real, complicated, difficult truth. And it's worth everything you'll sacrifice to find it.</p>

<p>You are not alone in this. Even when it feels like you are. Even when the truth makes you strange. Even when the universe shows you things others won't believe. You are not alone.</p>
