            The stories that find me in dark corners of the internet, whispered confessions, 
            and messages that remind me why vulnerability in art matters. These are the voices 
            of people who understand that beauty lives in broken places.

            <p class="intro-text">
                This page exists because art is meant to be a conversation, not a monologue. Every song I write, 
                every chapter I publish, every raw diary entry I share—it's all an invitation for connection. 
                What I never expected was how deeply that invitation would be accepted.
            </p>
            
            <div class="intro-quote">
                "When someone tells you that your broken song helped them feel less alone in their darkness, 
                you realize that vulnerability isn't just brave—it's necessary. These stories are proof that 
                authentic art creates authentic connection."

            <p class="intro-text">
                The messages below are real—shared with permission, some with names changed to protect privacy. 
                They represent the conversations happening in private messages, the reviews that make me cry, 
                and the random encounters that remind me why I do this work. If any of these resonate with you, 
                know that you're part of something bigger. A community of people who refuse to pretend 
                everything is fine when it's not.

When 'You Don't Have To Say You're Sorry' started playing, I just broke down and cried. Someone finally understood that I wasn't broken for struggling. Your lyrics about not having to apologize for being human—that saved me that night. I've been following your work ever since, and honestly, your honesty about your own journey gives me permission to be honest about mine. Thank you for refusing to make art that's comfortable. The world needs more people willing to say the hard things."

            I wanted to write and tell you that your vulnerability gives others permission to be human. I discovered your work during a particularly dark period—questioning my faith, struggling with family relationships, and feeling like I didn't fit anywhere. Your diary entries about leaving high-control religion, your songs about not apologizing for struggling, your books that don't shy away from difficult truths—they created a space where my pain felt valid instead of shameful. 
            <br><br>
            You write about things most people whisper about. You sing about emotions most people hide. You create characters who are beautifully broken instead of perfectly healed. In a world that wants us to pretend everything is fine, you insist on telling the truth about what it actually feels like to be human. That courage is contagious.
            <br><br>
            I started therapy. I started writing in my own journal. I started having honest conversations with people instead of performing happiness. Your willingness to be seen in your struggle gave me permission to stop hiding in mine. I don't know if you realize how much your work matters, but it does. More than you know.
